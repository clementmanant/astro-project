        description: "HELSINKI — China is sharpening the details of its Tianwen-3 mission to collect samples from Mars and deliver them to Earth. \n\nNew mission details and defined objectives were revealed in presentations made at the International Conference of Deep Space Sciences in Hefei, Anhui province, April 22. \n\nThe mission will use a pair of Long March 5 rockets to send two separate spacecraft stacks towards the Red Planet around 2030 with the goal of collecting and returning 500 grams of samples. \n\nThe mission objectives include searching for evidence for life on Mars, understanding environmental and climate evolution of the Red Planet and its potential past habitability. \n\nThe two Long March 5 launches will carry a lander and ascent vehicle and an orbiter and return module respectively. Entry, descent and landing will build on technology used for the Zhurong rover landing as part of China’s Tianwen-1 Mars mission. \n\nSampling will, as with China’s 2020 Chang’e-5 lunar sample return mission, use a lander-based robotic arm to collect surface samples and a drill to collect material from up to two meters below the surface. \n\nIn a new development, the landing segment will also have limited capacity to collect samples close to the landing site, using either a six-legged crawling robot or an Ingenuity-like helicopter. The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) unveiled a prototype of the latter in 2021. \n\nCollected samples will be sent into Mars orbit using a two-stage ascent vehicle. It will consist of a solid first stage and liquid propellant upper stage with a total mass of at least 360 kilograms. \n\nThe ascent vehicle will then dock with the orbiter and return module, with docking assisted by a robotic arm. Collected materials will then be transferred to the return module for the return to Earth. \n\nThe vague timeline for launch suggests, but does not confirm, a slip from a previously stated 2028 launch timetable. \n\nA mission profile for China’s Mars sample return presented in June 2022 targeted launch in late 2028 with samples delivered to Earth in July 2031. \n\nThe 2028 timeline would see samples delivered to Earth before the NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return mission. The mission likewise targets delivering around 500 grams of Martian samples to Earth. \n\nLanding site selection is being conducted with invited input from international teams. Engineering constraints mean the landing will take place between 17 and 30 degrees north latitude, due to energy and lighting requirements. The landing ellipsis will be 50 by 20 kilometers. \n\nProspective sites required to have an elevation of at least 3,000 meters below the zero-elevation level, or the equivalent to sea level on Earth. This provides the lander with more atmosphere to move through to slow its descent onto the Martian surface. \n\nSite selection will also be balanced by science objectives. The chosen site will need to be considered of astrobiological relevance, with Martian terrain older than 3.5 billion years being prioritized. \n\nEnvironments suitable for the emergence of life and its preservation such as sedimentary or hydrothermal systems, evidence of past aqueous activity and geological diversity were noted as key priorities. \n\nThe mission will also adhere to the highest standards of planetary protection protocols, according to the presentations. \n\nLiu Jizhong of the director of China’s Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center under the CNSA, and Hou Zengqian of the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences delivered the presentations in Hefei, which were later shared on Chinese social media.",

        description: "WASHINGTON — Astra Space won a task order worth $11.5 million to launch experimental payloads for the Defense Department’s Space Test Program. \n\nAstra, a small satellite launch company based in Alameda, California, was awarded the contract under the U.S. Space Force’s Orbital Services Program OSP-4, the Space Systems Command announced April 21. \n\nThe OSP-4 program is run by the Space Systems Command’s Small Launch and Targets Division at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n\nThe mission, named STP-S29B, is scheduled to fly in April 2025 on Astra’s new launch vehicle called Astra 4. It will carry an ESPA-class space vehicle and rideshare cubesats. \n\nThe STP-S29 mission was divided into two launches and awarded to two different providers. \n\nSTP-S29A was awarded last year to Northrop Grumman, The company won a $29.9 million task order to launch the mission in September 2024 on a Minotaur 4 small launch vehicle. \n\nSTP-S29B, awarded to Astra, is a “complex mission that will conduct scientific experiments and technology demonstrations with the goal of advancing DoD’s space capabilities,” said Col. Justin Beltz, chief of the Small Launch and Targets Division. \n\n\nHigher mission assurance \n\n\nAstra was pre-qualified for the OSP-4 program in August 2021. OSP-4 is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracting vehicle for rapid acquisition of launch services. Vendors compete for individual orders, and have to be able to launch payloads larger than 400 pounds to any orbit within 12 to 24 months from contract award. \n\nThe award to Astra “reflects the tremendous promise industry is bringing to the table with systems like Rocket 4. We look forward to working with Astra to make this launch a success,” said Beltz. \n\nThe STP-S29B mission is a Category 2 mission assurance launch, which requires additional certifications and an independent risk assessment. \n\n“STP-S29B demands a higher level of mission assurance than previous Astra launches and therefore represents a significant increase in Astra’s coordination with the Space Force to perform a launch designed for mission success,” said Thomas Williams, senior director of federal sales at Astra. \n\nAstra is targeting the first launch of its Rocket 4 vehicle before the end of the year. \n\nIt is a new vehicle the company designed to carry heavier payloads than the previous Astra Rocket 3.3. Astra discontinued the development of Rocket 3.3 after it failed to deploy two NASA Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) satellites in June 2022.",

        description: "WASHINGTON — The U.S. Space Force in its 2024 budget allocated $59 million to buy satellite communications services from SES’ new broadband constellation in medium Earth orbit known as O3b mPower. \n\nThe purchase was made under a NATO contracting vehicle established last year for countries to acquire commercial satcom services. Both the U.S. and Luxembourg have agreed to buy mPower satcom services under NATO’s Global Commercially Contracted Satellite Communications. \n\nUnder the agreement, a portion of the O3b mPower constellation will be assigned to the U.S. and Luxembourg for defense and security uses. \n\nSES is a global satellite operator headquartered in Luxembourg. The services to the U.S. military are provided by the company’s U.S. subsidiary SES Space & Defense, based in Reston, Virginia. \n\nThis procurement of satcom services is “an example of what we’re doing with international partners and with commercial industry,” Lt. Gen. Phillip Garrant, deputy chief of space operations for strategy, plans, programs and requirements, told SpaceNews in a recent interview. \n\nAccess to commercial satcom services from all available orbits is important for resiliency, he said. “It gives us diversity, high throughput, low-latency satcom.” \n\nDoD for years has been a customer of SES’ O3b constellation in medium Earth orbit (MEO) but this is the company’s first military contract for the next-generation mPower satellites. The first two of 11 planned mPower satellites launched to orbit in December on a SpaceX rocket. SES says each will provide 10 times more throughput than the legacy O3b satellites. \n\nJay Icard, senior vice president of SES Space & Defense, told SpaceNews that current U.S. military users of the O3b satcom service will be able to access mPower from their existing ground terminals. \n\n\nU.S seeks more partnerships \n\n\nDoD’s purchase of mPower satcom services was first announced in February by Deanna Ryals, director of international affairs at the Space Force’s Space Systems Command. \n\nIn a speech at the GovSatcom conference in Luxembourg, Ryals said her office had been in discussions for some time with Luxembourg’s ministry of defense about setting up a partnership that would serve as a model for other countries to join. \n\n“We’re going into a future that’s focused on hybrid architectures, resiliency and combined warfighting capabilities,” Ryals said. The U.S. Space Force, she said, is “building a hybrid architecture that includes our commercial partners and our international partners’ national sovereign systems.” \n\nThe MEO layer in the architecture, she said, will be called “DoD mPower.” \n\n“This is the future,” Ryals added. “All of our future architectures are going to look like this … a combination of DoD purpose built, our allies’ national sovereign systems, and commercial capabilities.” \n\n\nAgreements for polar satcom \n\n\nWith regard to government-owned satcom systems, she said, the U.S. is interested in partnering with allies that are investing in sovereign national systems such as Australia and the United Kingdom. \n\n“We’re trying to figure out how do we work together from the beginning, and how do we take advantage of the capabilities each is building?” Ryals said. \n\n“Canada will be building another Polar Satellite Communication project later in the 2020s. We’re looking at how we collaborate for the high north. Norway is looking at their follow-on system,” she said. “These are systems in areas where the United States doesn’t have to go it alone anymore.” \n\nThe U.S. Space Force, meanwhile, is seeking partners for government-owned communications satellites, including the newest Wideband Global Satcom WGS-12 that Congress funded in the 2023 defense budget. \n\nThe WGS constellation, with 10 satellites in orbit and one scheduled to launch in 2025, already has multiple international partners, Ryals added. “WGS-12 is now real. We’re actively working with our international partners to figure out how do we do this again.” \n\nThe Space Force also is eyeing international partners for its future Protected Tactical Satcom constellation, Ryals said. \n\nAn issue that gets in the way of partnerships are U.S. restrictions on the sharing of information with foreign nationals, she said. “One of the biggest challenges that we have had to date working with our allies and partners, and often with our commercial industry, is the ability to share information.” \n\nDocuments related to space programs, for example, are stamped “NoForn” so they can’t be shared. Ryals said the Space Force wants to move to a  “YesForn” policy that would allow exchanges with allies and partners. “The United States Department of Defense is working on new policies and strategies to remove those barriers to information sharing,” he said. “and you will see those changes this year.”",

        description: "TAMPA, Fla. — Inmarsat has restored maritime and aviation safety capabilities on its I-4 F1 satellite over Asia Pacific but is still trying to recover services for L-band phones that have been down for nearly a week. \n\nAll services on the spacecraft have been restored following the outage except for its Global Satellite Phone Service (GSPS), an Inmarsat spokesperson said April 21, although work continues on “optimizing performance and addressing some specific residual issues.” \n\nThe operator declined to detail these residual issues but said safety services that include its maritime distress signal business Inmarsat C “are operating normally” on the 18-year-old spacecraft, serving East Asia and the Pacific region. \n\nI-4 F1 suffered a partial loss of power April 16 that “invoked automatic procedures on the satellite that led to the suspension of services,” according to the company. \n\nMaritime safety services were immediately transferred to a contingency satellite elsewhere in the operator’s fleet during the outage, in compliance with rules overseen by the International Mobile Satellite Organization. \n\nThese maritime services were transferred back after I-4 F1 was recovered April 18, the same day Inmarsat restored connectivity for aviation customers. \n\nWhile engineers are still investigating the root cause of the power issue, Inmarsat has ruled out space debris or anything malicious, such as a cyber attack. \n\nThe satellite was built by EADS Astrium, now Airbus Defense and Space, and was launched in 2005 with an initial 13-year design life. \n\nThe Airbus-built I-6 F1 satellite that launched in December 2021 is slated to replace many of I-4 F1’s L-band services “in the coming months,” Inmarsat said. \n\nInmarsat has not said how many partners or customers have been affected by its I-4 F1 issues.
